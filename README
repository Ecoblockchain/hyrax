This is README describes how to use the very simple scripts here to clone
and build Hyrax using the 17 or so repositories that contain its various
source code modules. This is a temporary solution that will use the code
we have migrated from subversion to git while we work on a more long-term
solution.

Note that the repos on GitHub have all of the branches and tags; after
a clone, use branch -a to see them. 

The recipe - short version - which leaves out building the third-party
packages that Hyrax needs to build all of the modules associated with
a full build:

0 build the dependencies

1 source spath.sh 

2 ./hyrax_clone.sh

3 ./hyrax_build.sh

The longer version:

1. Get and build the 'hyrax-dependencies' by either cloning the that
repo (https://github.com/OPENDAP/hyrax-dependencies) or downloading
the tarball from:

    http://www.opendap.org/pub/binary/tmp/hyrax-dependencies-1.9.5.tar

Note that since this a collection of tar.gz files, it is not
compressed itself

2. Set up the 'prefix' and 'PATH' environment variables in the shell
you're using. 
 
3. Now clone all of the source repos for Hyrax using the 'hyrax_clone.sh'
script. This will take a while, but it's not too bad. The script takes
two options: verbose (-v) and dry_run (-n).

4. Build the code using the 'hyrax_build.sh' script. It takes three
options: verbose (-v), dry_run (-n) and prefix (-p). You don't need to
use the prefix option. However, a log of what it did will help sort
out problems (i.e., ./hyrax_build.sh -v 2&>1 | tee guild.log).

The 'hyrax_clean.sh' will remove all the built stuff so you can run
hyrax_build.sh from scratch.
